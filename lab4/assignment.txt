Create a Jupyter notebook performing numerical integration of an advection-diffusion problem
using upwind scheme, and comparing the result to an analytic solution (e.g., the one from lab_02). 

Create a GitHub Action executing the notebook (see https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/) 
and uploading the resultant pdf as an action artefact (see https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact).

Scoring:
- 20% narrative explaining a physical problem the solution may model
- 20% code implementing analytic solution
- 20% code implementing numerical integration
- 20% code comparing the two (plot + some quantitative measure)
- 20% narrative explaining the conclusion

Essentials: automation leading to vector graphics plot embedded in the pdf with author's name, uploaded as 
GitHub Action artefact. Analysis, plot and resultant pdf should be computed in the cloud.

Submission: sending the location of the repository by e-mail to sylwester.arabas@agh.edu.pl
