Extend the Jupyter notebook performing numerical integration using MPDATA by implementing 
arbitrary number of corrective iterations.

Create a GitHub Action executing the notebook (see https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/) 
and uploading the resultant pdf as an action artefact (see https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact).

Scoring:
- 33% code implementing multiple iterations
- 33% code depicting how results change with 1, 2, 3, 4... iterations
- 33% narrative explaining the results

Essentials: automation leading to plots (vector graphics!) or animations embedded in the pdf 
with author's name, uploaded as GitHub Action artefact. Analysis, plot and resultant pdf should 
be computed in the cloud.

Submission: sending the location of the repository by e-mail to sylwester.arabas@agh.edu.pl
